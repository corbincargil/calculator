# Calculator


## Description:

A simple webpage calculator that does basic arithmetic. The goal of this project was to practice advanced DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript array methods, and writing clean, readable code. I also got some good practice making branches using Git and refactoring my code for different versions of the caclulator. 

This project was a part of The Odin Project curriculum.
